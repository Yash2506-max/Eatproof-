EatProof is a simple and smart product verification system that uses AI and blockchain to check whether any food, medicine, oil, or supplement is safe and genuine. When a user scans a product, EatProof reads the label, extracts important details, detects harmful or suspicious ingredients, checks expiry and tampering, and verifies authenticity using on-chain records stored on IPFS. The goal is to help people quickly identify unsafe or fake products and to make product verification fast, accurate, and completely transparent.
